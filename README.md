 The "Map Viewer Application for VJTI" project aims to
 develop an intuitive and user-friendly tool for browsing and
 interacting with maps tailored specifically for the VJTI
 community. This application incorporates essential
 functionalities such as zooming, panning, and layer
 switching, empowering users to navigate seamlessly
 through geographic data. 
Leveraging modern technologies and a robust system
 architecture, the project delivers a responsive and feature
rich map viewer. Through this endeavor, users can access
 and explore maps with ease, facilitating better
 understanding and utilization of spatial information within
 the VJTI environment.
